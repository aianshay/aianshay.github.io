# Why I'm doing this blog

My goal with this blog is to share some ideas that I think are interesting, most of them will probably be something I read on some books, it may vary from computer science, AI, physics, astronomy, biology, economics, psychology etc. Nature is not divided as our educational system may indicate, so all of this can come together eventually. 

Sharing ideas is a way to exercise what I've learned as well, so everything I share here is probably some stuff that have impacted me in a meaningful way and I don't wanna forget anytime soon, but it doesn't mean I cannot change my mind about a post or a subject. Of course reality is not only science but I will always try to be supported by evidence, as far as my knowledge can reach at the time.

Regards,
Aian.
