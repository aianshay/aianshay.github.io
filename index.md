Hello and welcome to my blog. 

Currently, I'm a senior computer science student at the [Federal University of Para](http://www.ufpa.br) in Brazil. I do research trying to understand what challenges developers face when building database-centric applications. I'm also a Copyeditor at [JSERD](https://http://jserd.sbc.org.br/). In the past, I also researched NLP and flaky tests to detect flaky tests using machine learning models such as Naive Bayes and SVMs.
