Hello and welcome to my personal blog. Currently I'm a senior computer science student at the [Federal University of Para](http://www.ufpa.br) in Brazil. I do research involving a mix of artificial intelligence and software engineering, our goal is to detect flaky tests using some models such as Naive Bayes and SVMs.
